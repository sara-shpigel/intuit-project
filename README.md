If I had more time available, here are the improvements I would make to the project:

**Enhanced Visual Representation:** I'd enhance the visual representation of the FSM by creating a more interactive and visually appealing graphical interface. Users would be able to intuitively interact with state transitions directly within the application interface, providing a more engaging user experience.

**Advanced State Management:** I'd implement advanced state management features, such as hierarchical states or nested state machines, to accommodate even more complex application logic and workflows. This would enable developers to build sophisticated applications with intricate state structures.

**Integration with External Tools:** Integrating the FSM library with popular development tools and frameworks like Redux or would be a priority. This integration would provide seamless compatibility with existing React.js applications, enhancing developer productivity and facilitating smoother adoption of the FSM library within larger projects.

**Performance Optimization:** I'd focus on optimizing the performance of the FSM library by refining algorithms and data structures. By implementing efficient solutions, we can ensure faster state transitions and improved scalability, making the library suitable for handling large-scale applications without compromising performance.

**Code Readability Improvements:** I would enhance the readability of the codebase by introducing constants for string literals and adhering to consistent coding conventions. This would improve code maintainability and facilitate easier understanding, debugging, and collaboration among developers working on the project.
