Improvements (If More Time Were Available)
If additional time were available, here are some enhancements I would make to the project:

Enhanced Visual Representation: Implement a more interactive and visually appealing graphical representation of the FSM, allowing users to interact with the state transitions directly within the application interface.

Advanced State Management: Introduce advanced state management features, such as hierarchical states or nested state machines, to support even more complex application logic and workflows.

Integration with External Tools: Integrate the FSM library with popular development tools and frameworks, such as Redux or MobX, to provide seamless integration with existing React.js applications and enhance developer productivity.

Performance Optimization: Optimize the performance of the FSM library by implementing efficient algorithms and data structures, enabling faster state transitions and better scalability for large-scale applications.

Expanded Documentation and Tutorials: Provide comprehensive documentation and tutorials covering various aspects of the FSM library, including usage examples, best practices, and troubleshooting guides, to support developers in effectively utilizing the library in their projects.
